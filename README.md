# Text-processing Information retrieval and information extraction

The author implemented simple rule base  solution approach for information retrieval and information extraction after which the result were analyzed. 

The author improved the result of the previous approach by implementing machine learning (support vector machine) approach for information retrieval and information extraction. The result will be discussed and analyzed. 

The Author will further analyze and critically appraise the performance of simple rule base solution and machine learning (support vector machine) methods and discuss the suitability, advantages and drawbacks of these methods for text analysis

The author implemented a new text to speech algorithm for the new result of information etarction and  retrieval using machine leaning.
